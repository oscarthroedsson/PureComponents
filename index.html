        <h1>Building My Own Component Library</h1>
        <p>
          Over the past few months, I embarked on an exciting project – building my own component library from scratch.
          This library isn’t just a collection of reusable components, but a fully customized solution designed with
          performance, accessibility, and ease of use in mind. The goal is to create a flexible tool that developers can
          seamlessly integrate into their projects, whether they're working on a small website or a large-scale
          application.

        <h2>Why Build a Custom Library?</h2>
        <p>
          The idea to create my own component library came from realizing that existing options often lack the
          combination of style and functionality I needed in my projects. Some libraries offer impressive functionality
          but require extensive customization, while others focus too much on aesthetics, sacrificing accessibility or
          performance. By building my own library, I can control every detail, from how the components look to how they
          function under the hood.
        </p>

        <h3>Focus on Accessibility and Semantics</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important aspects of my work is accessibility. I want to ensure that all components adhere to
          best practices for web accessibility (WCAG) and are easy to use for people who rely on screen readers or other
          assistive technologies. Every component is designed with correct semantic HTML, and I integrate ARIA
          attributes where necessary to enhance interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Simplicity and Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          The components in the library are built to be as flexible as possible without compromising simplicity. This
          means each component comes with predefined styles and functionality, but developers always have the option to
          easily override these styles or extend functionality as needed. By leveraging modern JavaScript and
          TypeScript, I ensure that the codebase remains robust and maintainable.
