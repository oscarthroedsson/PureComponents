# 🧽 PureComponents

A component library I'm building to deepen my knowledge of semantics and CSS. Based on my past work and life experience, I strongly believe everything comes back to the basics. Even though there are many incredible component libraries out there, creating my own feels like a valuable learning experience.

## 🥅 Goals
I aim to make this a lightweight, easy-to-use library. It's intended for people who may not be design enthusiasts, who are new, or who want to learn more about semantics. Our goal isn’t to be the best, dominate the component world, or become the largest. This is just a fun project, and who knows—one day, it might even become an NPM package.
